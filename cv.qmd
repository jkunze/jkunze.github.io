<span class="small">*RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT*</span>

<span class="small">**Information Standards**</span>

<span class="small">Aggregate File Formats: primary author of the
BagIt packaging format for disk-based or network-based storage and
transfer of generalized digital content; co-author of the WARC (Web
Archive) file format published as ISO 28500:2009; Standards Group lead
for the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC); member of
the IIPC Technical Committee</span>

<span class="small">Metadata Semantic Standards: primary author of RFC
5013 Dublin Core (DC) metadata specification; founder and chair of the
DC Kernel Metadata workgroup; chair of the National Information
Standards Organization committee that moved the DC metadata
specification to approval as NISO Z39.85 (2001); co-author and editor of
the original DC metadata specification, RFC 2413; member of the DC
Advisory Board; chair of the DC Agents and DC Date working groups;
inventor in 1992 of the Z39.50 Info-1 generic attribute and element set,
a precursor of DC</span>

<span class="small">Metadata Syntax Standards: author of the
specification for encoding Dublin Core in HTML, RFC 2731; author of the
ANVL (A Name Value Language) specification for simple labels and values
in the style of RFC822; author of the TEMPER specification for dates;
inventor of the Z39.50 Generic Record Syntax (GRS)</span>

<span class="small">Uniform Resource Identifiers: in the context of
the URI working group of the IETF, coined the term, URC (originally
Uniform Resource Citation); contributed substantively to the URL
standard itself, which includes authoring RFC 1736, functional
requirements for the URL; led the creation of RFC 2056 describing Z39.50
URLs</span>

<span class="small">**Electronic Permanence**</span>

<span class="small">Digital Curation Tools: conceived a number of
standalone tools, some incorporated into the Oxford Common File Layout
(OCFL) specification, that support curation and preservation as
embedded, distributed infrastructure rather than as part of a monolithic
repository system that imposes a single archival culture on digital
collections: Pairtree, Dflat, ReDD, Checkm, Namaste, CAN (Content Access
Node); wrote and documented portable open-source software to support the
tools; co-authored the curation micro-services approach being
implemented at the California Digital Library (CDL)</span>

<span class="small">Dataset Preservation: in December 2006 did a
six-week Digital Curation Centre (DCC) fellowship with the Database
Research Group at the University of Edinburgh, consulting with directors
and staff at all four DCC sites regarding database preservation
requirements and strategies; Preservation Group lead on a winning NSF
DataNet proposal (led by University of New Mexico)</span>

<span class="small">Web Archiving: wrote the core service vision in a
winning NDIIPP grant proposal to the Library of Congress to create a
service allowing curators to harvest and preserve web sites on demand,
creating a geographically replicated archive that they can annotate,
browse, and search; results of this 3-year grant used to advise congress
on a national preservation strategy; provided critical technical
leadership throughout implementation of CDL’s web archiving service,
including technical collaboration with grant partners (e.g., UNT,
NYU)</span>

<span class="small">Permanence Ratings: defined the framework for and
participated centrally in the US National Library of Medicine’s
multi-dimensional specification of permanence levels (about object
availability, content invariance, and identifier validity); this work
was published and the framework adopted by the US National Agriculture
Library; built on this work for ARK persistence statements</span>

<span class="small">ARK Persistent Identification Scheme: at NLM,
analyzed 1998-era persistent naming schemes (URN, DOI, PURL, PDI), and
formulated a new scheme, the Archival Resource Key (ARK), founded on the
principle that persistence is purely about the service commitments of
current object holders, not scheme syntax or the intent of name
assigners that have no extant object service responsibility</span>

<span class="small">Persistent Identifier Infrastructure and Outreach:  
at CDL, built a generalized identifier minting, binding, and resolving
system ("noid") that produces random, unique, non-sequential identifiers
designed for permanence; these are compact, transcribable, semantically
opaque, and furnished with a check character that guarantees each in the
face of single digit and transcription errors; built and prototyped with
a set of international partners the Name-To-Thing (N2T) resolver as a
low-cost, low-risk consortially owned resolver for hundreds of
identifier schemes (ARK, DOI, URN, PDB, etc.); gave talks on these
subjects at international meetings; founded the ARK Alliance (arks.org)
to sustain ARK infrastructure</span>

<span class="small">**Networked Information Systems**</span>

<span class="small">THUMP Protocol: designed The HTTP URL Mapping
Protocol (THUMP), a set of URL-based conventions for retrieving
information and conducting searches using a simple procedure call syntax
in the URL query string and an ANVL syntax for returned records; worked
with researchers at RENCI to extend it for dataset queries</span>

<span class="small">Z39.50 Protocol: at UC Berkeley, designed, wrote,
and released the first complete Z39.50 client and server protocol
engine, participating in the first three-way interoperability
demonstration at NET ’92 with UC Office of the President (UCOP) and Penn
State; worked within the Z39.50 Implementors Group to create and win
adoption of the Generic Record Syntax in support of non-bibliographic
applications; at NLM, designed and wrote a Z39.50 server for the MEDLINE
database, and designed a generalized thesaurus mechanism (Structured
Vocabulary Browse) to work with NLM’s MeSH headings; at UC San Francisco
(UCSF), directed a team of programmers in developing a Web interface and
HTTP/Z39.50 gateway to MEDLINE; for UCOP, developed the first production
instance of the Web-based MELVYL system’s access methods for external
Z39.50 databases (in this case, to PreMEDLINE running at NLM)</span>

<span class="small">Online Information Systems: proposed, designed,
wrote, and maintained in production a client-server CWIS information
system, Infocal, which provided the first general online access to UC
Berkeley’s main administrative datasets (schedule of classes, course
catalog, phone directories, job vacancy listings, press releases); in
the pre-Web era, this required extensive liaison with management and
staff of campus units that maintained these datasets, and who were
intimidated by information technology, unsure of the benefits of online
access, and anxious about losing control over their data; Infocal was
also an early client (1992) of both the Z39.50 and Web protocols (HTTP,
Gopher, FTP)</span>

<span class="small">Computer Aided Instruction: designed, wrote, and
maintained the Berkeley UNIX *help* system, a general-purpose online
information system for exploring documentation files, directories, and
executables (it had a user interface foreshadowing that of the Gopher
browser); revived and significantly enhanced the UNIX *learn* program, a
hypertext-based teaching tool from Bell Labs (late 1970s); both *help*
and *learn* were disseminated globally with 4.2/4.3BSD (Berkeley
Software Distribution); by 1982 the production *help* documentation tree
was replicated on a daily basis across about twenty file servers on the
Berkeley campus network</span>

<span class="small">**Digital Libraries**</span>

<span class="small">Tobacco Control Research Collection: at UCSF,
architected the American Legacy Foundation-funded Legacy National
Tobacco Documents Library, some 40 million page images released by court
order from the world’s major tobacco companies; during the
implementation phase, focused on problems of poor indexing, corrupt or
missing data, and incorporation of new material via web crawlers from
ever-changing industry sites; wrote the main software components that
support access via persistent identifiers and the browsing of individual
document pages</span>

<span class="small">Tobacco Document Digitization: created a detailed
processing specification for digitizing shops to use in converting paper
documents into standardized digital objects suitable for incorporation
into digital library collections; this included scanning to create page
images, OCRing to extract searchable text, and indexing (the hand-keying
of metadata such as author, title, etc.)</span>

<span class="small">Search Engine: wrote a new digital library
searching and ranking engine designed to fill the gap between full text
engines and fielded search systems, and to scale to millions of objects;
the resulting system, tested on 1.5 million text objects and their
metadata, performed fast boolean searching with wildcards and term list
scanning</span>

<span class="small">Electronic Publishing: managed the
subscription-based electronic publication of the UC Press book, "The
Cigarette Papers"; this experiment explored technical and marketing
aspects of online publishing with access fees</span>

<span class="small">Printer Cost Recovery: at UCSF, architected a
network-based charging mechanism for publicly available print stations,
a problem that plagued libraries across the country; the resulting
system was probably the first low-cost solution enabling the library
directly to manage all aspects of the authorization and routing
technology involved</span>

<span class="small">Authentication Infrastructure: at UCSF,
architected the development of a network-queryable campus authentication
infrastructure, requiring coordination with the campus units that supply
payroll and student registration data on an ongoing basis; oversaw the
development of various campus proxy servers</span>

<span class="small">**Computer Operating Systems**</span>

<span class="small">Performance Analysis: wrote programs to summarize
and plot UNIX 4.2BSD file system activity; debugged kernel traces and a
multi-strategy cache simulator based on them (presented at ACM SigOps,
1985)</span>

<span class="small">Heterogeneous Distributed Systems: worked on a
project (1985) to bring up ULTRIX and VMS clients on a network of fully
sharable computing resources, including file servers and print servers;
wrote ULTRIX kernel code to implement a transport-level network
interface, consisting of routines to generate server-side programs in a
simple network command language</span>

<span class="small">Command-Level Operating System Primitives:  
conceived a method of general-purpose software tool design; wrote three
UNIX tools distributed with 4.2/4.3BSD using this method (Master’s
Degree Project, 1983); these tools ("jot", "rs", and "lam") are
distributed in current Mac OS X systems</span>

<span class="small">VLSI Coprocessor Design: worked on the design for
a decimal coprocessor that IBM implemented along with Micro/370, an
IBM/370 architecture on a chip; wrote and tested microcode for the
decimal EDIT AND MARK instruction (1984)</span>

<span class="small">Terminal Capability Database: in the early 1980’s,
maintained the Berkeley UNIX *termcap* file for a period of about five
years; this file remains an integral part of modern Linux and other
UNIX-based systems</span>

<span class="small">**Communication/Instruction**</span>

<span class="small">Community Service: chaired the Digital Library
Federation’s (DLF) Developers Forum from 2005-2008, bringing it from
near-extinction to thriving success; participated as panel organizer, as
session chair, and/or as member of program committee for numerous
conferences and meetings, such as PIDapalooza, IWAW, Open Repositories,
iPRES, JCDL, ECDL, etc.; for several years presented at and advised the
CENDI Persistent Identification Task Group (E-Government) Chaired the
NSF DataONE Preservation and Metadata Working Group 2009-2014.</span>

<span class="small">Intellectual Property: consulted with the World
Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva regarding design of a
federated IP digital library (covering patents, trademarks, designs, and
traditional knowledge), and developed a proof-of-concept demonstration
system</span>

<span class="small">Instructional Support: at UCSF, managed the
creation of a flexible software system for faculty to author and
maintain course home pages</span>

<span class="small">Instruction: at UC Berkeley, accrued ten years’
experience in general consulting (advising) with users, students, and
programmers on UNIX and IBM CMS; teaching assistant for undergraduate
computer architecture; seven years’ experience designing and teaching
courses on UNIX and CMS; outside UCB, gave several week-long corporate
training sessions (at AT&T, NCC, IRS) on Common Lisp and UNIX</span>

<span class="small">SIGWEB: created and organized a 400-person,
all-day event at UCB for the SF Bay Area special interest group in state
of the art network information retrieval applications; recruited most of
the speakers and presented at this 1994 meeting</span>

<span class="small">Common Lisp: as a private consultant, was designer
and principal author of the 899-page manual, *Common Lisp: the
Reference* (Addison-Wesley, 1988); supervised two co-authors for this
work</span>

<span class="small">*PROFESSIONAL HISTORY*</span>

<span class="small">7/22 to present</span>

<span class="small">SENIOR RESEARCH ASSOCIATE − Drexel University</span>

<span class="small">Guided students and interns in the ongoing development of
the YAMZ.net metadictionary and its use of ARK identifiers while leading the
ARK Alliance expansion to over 1700 organizations.
</span>

<span class="small">1/14 to 7/22</span>

<span class="small">IDENTIFIER SYSTEMS ARCHITECT − UCOP CDL</span>

<span class="small">Led the expansion of the EZID.cdlib.org identifier
service, the N2T resolver, and the YAMZ.net metadictionary. Added a
formal agreement between n2t.net and identifiers.org to support compact
identifiers for over 700 identifier schemes. Founded and led the ARK
Alliance (arks.org) to sustain the ARK technical specification, its
supporting registry, and the global ARK resolver. There are now over
1200 ARK organizations, including 10 national libraries, 145
universities, 184 archives, 75 journals, and major museums such as the
Louvre, Smithsonian, and Frick.</span>

<span class="small">1/10 to 1/14</span>

<span class="small">ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, UC CURATION CENTER − UCOP
CDL</span>

<span class="small">Provided leadership, strategy, and vision for
creation of CDL’s approach to curation of research datasets and
scholarly digital assets. Author of a number of micro-service
specifications, including Pairtree, ReDD, Checkm, Namaste, and chief
designer of the EZID identifier service and N2T resolver system. For the
NSF DataONE initiative, I was technical lead on two of the first six NSF
DataONE member node repositories (at CDL), leader of the Preservation
and Metadata working group, member of the Leadership Team, and Core
Cyberinfrastructure Team. I was heavily involved in the design and
specification of the award-winning DataUp tool for curating spreadsheet
data (CDL partnership with Micrsoft Research) and a simple approach to
publishing data papers. Co-Lead on the implementation of YAMZ, an online
crowdsourced metadata dictionary.</span>

<span class="small">2/03 to 12/09</span>

<span class="small">PRESERVATION TECHNOLOGIES ARCHITECT − UCOP
CDL</span>

<span class="small">While leading strategic and technical aspects of the
digital preservation program at CDL, I authored a web archiving service
vision for a winning grant proposal (\$2.4M) from the Library of
Congress. I was technical lead for that project and worked at several
levels on the design and implementation of CDL’s digital preservation
repository. During this time I represented the CDL at the national level
(NIH/NLM, NARA, GPO) and international level (British Library, DCC (UK),
National Library of Canada, National Library of France, etc). I also
served as CDL technical representative to national and international
standards bodies (NISO, IETF, Dublin Core) and consortia (IIPC, DLF,
W3C) and provided leadership for CDL’s Advanced Technology Group and
programmer teams at NYU and UNT.</span>

<span class="small">5/01 to 1/03</span>

<span class="small">DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL PLANNING, LNTDL − UCSF CKM and
UCOP CDL</span>

<span class="small">While maintaining a partial appointment with the
California Digital Library (CDL, at UC Office of the President), I
provided technical leadership for the Legacy National Tobacco Documents
Library hosted at the UC San Francisco Library and Center for Knowledge
Management. Already the most important center for tobacco control
documents, the UCSF Library was selected for this enormous new data set
and I was asked in August 2000 to draft the initial collection
architecture. I went on to architect and implement a major new and
significantly different collection, detailing the outsourced processing
requirements and developing a new search engine and interface.</span>

<span class="small">At UCOP, I worked with the content management
infrastructure group on defining persistent identifiers and common
metadata in an attempt to consolidate and rationalize management of a
diverse group of existing CDL datasets. There was also a strategic
education (UC wide) and planning (eg, for open source library tools)
component.</span>

<span class="small">5/98 to 4/01</span>

<span class="small">CONSULTANT, MEDICAL INFORMATICS − UCSF CKM and the
NLM</span>

<span class="small">Received a three-year grant (somewhat resembling a
fellowship) from the NLM to research persistent naming on the internet
and to advise NLM on what to do about electronic permanence. Across a
range of proposals and literature, I analyzed methods, algorithms,
performance, support implications, and social and institutional impacts.
My initial recommendation resulted in the formation of an NLM group to
define aspects of permanence directly relevant to NLM and designated for
review by the Library of Congress and the National Agriculture Library.
I also served as editor of this group’s permanence rating specification
and was a member of a follow-on group formed to create a plan for
implementing permanence at NLM. My final recommendation to NLM was to
use persistent names having the properties described in the Archival
Resource Key (ARK) draft. An ARK prototype system was set up at
NLM.</span>

<span class="small">During this period I continued to speak regularly
about my work, giving seminars at the Library of Congress, NLM (LHC)
Computer Science Branch, UCB Computer Science department, UCSF Medical
Informatics, UCB School of Information Management, and presentations to
the annual meeting of the Coalition for Networked Information and
various UC Library groups. I also maintained a fractional appointment to
advise the UCSF Library on technical planning, including hiring and
infrastructure. I served continuously during this time on the 9-campus
University of California working group on technology, architecture, and
standards for the California Digital Library (UCOP).</span>

<span class="small">10/95 to 4/98</span>

<span class="small">MANAGER, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY GROUP − Center for
Knowledge Management, UCSF</span>

<span class="small">Led a team of three programmers in designing and
implementing several major projects. The Medsage project resulted in a
production campus system for searching the MEDLINE database; components
included a WWW interface, links to 71 electronic journals stored locally
on an optical jukebox, an HTTP/Z39.50 gateway, and a MARC to HTML record
translator. A second major project built a campus authentication,
authorization, and charging infrastructure for multiple applications,
initially print charging from public workstations; other applications
included controlled access to electronic content, Web proxying for
dialin authentication, and an X509 certificate authority.</span>

<span class="small">8/94 to 8/95</span>

<span class="small">LEAD PROGRAMMER/RESEARCHER − National Library of
Medicine, Bethesda, MD</span>

<span class="small">Received a one-year grant from the NLM: (a) to
provide technical leadership for a team of five people setting up a
Z39.50 server for MEDLARS databases, and (b) to research new protocols
combining the strengths of Z39.50 and HTTP, particularly as they might
apply to the NLM Sourcerer project (for discovering network resources
and merging multi-server query results). During that year provided
ongoing technical guidance to three people maintaining Infocal.</span>

<span class="small">9/89 to 9/95</span>

<span class="small">LEAD PROGRAMMER − Infocal Project, UC
Berkeley</span>

<span class="small">As instigator and technical leader of the Infocal
project, my job was: (a) to design and implement software for an
information server and one or more clients and (b) to design and
supervise the maintenance of a growing body of campus information. The
Infocal project won material support from Sun, Apple, DEC, CNI, and
CNIDR. I made presentations on Infocal, on Z39.50, and on related work
at professional meetings for ASIS, SIGUCCS, LITA (ALA), IEEE, HPCC, and
BIREME. I supervised one position that created and monitored the mostly
automatic update procedures for campus data providers.</span>

<span class="small">The server was implemented in C, using as DBMS the
UNIX filesystem and a small ad hoc search engine, avoiding
administrative, functional, and performance problems of available DBMS
products. The first (and only) client was written in C and TCL and
functioned as a walkup campus kiosk system from about 200 terminals, as
a telnet destination for anyone on the internet, and as an email robot
for users who at least had an internet mail stop.</span>

<span class="small">While this client could establish Z39.50 sessions
with other servers, the protocol had only just matured (Version 3) to
the point where it interoperably supported the server’s browsing and
non-bibliographic data requirements, so the client used a patchwork of
older protocols. This and the risk of compromising the security of the
campus network prevented the client code from being released to compete
with other emerging systems (Web, Gopher, Prospero). The need to link to
an increasing number of external targets in the multi-protocol internet
led to my modifying the client to use the WWW protocol suite.</span>

<span class="small">9/77 to 8/89</span>

<span class="small">PROGRAMMER − 50-100% time, Information Systems and
Technology, UC Berkeley</span>

<span class="small">As programmer for six years, I worked in a team of
four people in charge of UNIX, microcomputers, and networking, with one
year as acting manager. Before then, I consulted, taught, and documented
UNIX, IBM CMS, and Calidoscope (a Berkeley version of CDC 6400 Scope)
operating systems. As a system administrator, I designed a standard
campus Ultrix configuration for about 150 microvaxes and consulted with
users on VAX and Macintosh computers.</span>

<span class="small">5/85 to 8/85</span>

<span class="small">RESEARCH INTERN − Digital Equipment Corp., Eastern
Research Lab, Hudson, MA</span>

<span class="small">Worked with the distributed systems architecture
team in researching, designing, and prototyping a heterogeneous
distributed systems project. The main features of the design were a fast
RPC-style protocol, a machine-independent network command language, and
shared access to resources by ULTRIX, VMS, and MS-DOS. I worked on the
ULTRIX kernel transport and network interface routines.</span>
