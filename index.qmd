John Kunze is a pioneer in the theory and practice of digital libraries. His
passion for creating and sharing free, open, pragmatic digital solutions has
guided his long public sector career. As a Berkeley undergrad in computer
science and mathematics, he wrote software that comes pre-installed in every
Mac and Linux system. He had leading roles in establishing identifier standards
(URL, ARK), metadata standards (Dublin Core), archiving standards (BagIt,
WARC), the Z39.50 library protocol, UC Berkeley's first Campus Wide Information
System, and repository microservices used in HathTrust and OCFL. He is
currently leading the [ARK Alliance](https://arks.org) forward and serving as
a senior research associate at Drexel University, where he is working on the
crowdsourced vocabulary tool, [yamz.net](https://yamz.net).

* Participating in open source at the University of California (UC) Berkeley
from 1978-1983, 20 years before that term was coined, Kunze\* began fixing BSD
Unix bugs and writing tools that come pre-installed in today's Mac and Linux
systems ([jot](https://man.openbsd.org/jot.1),
[lam](https://man.openbsd.org/lam.1), [rs](https://man.openbsd.org/rs.1)).
During that time he maintained the global terminal capability database
([termcap](https://man.openbsd.org/termcap.5)), created an online Unix help
system, brought the Bell Labs Unix
"[learn](https://wolfram.schneider.org/bsd/7thEdManVol2/learn/learn.html)"
program and its computer-aided instruction scripts to life, and became
principal author of the book [Common Lisp: the
Reference](https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t68350d1q).
Realizing that content is king in information technology, he became interested
in working with libraries and archives.

* In 1989 he proposed and began creating UC Berkeley's first Campus Wide
Information System (CWIS).\† Into that system, called
[Infocal](https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2mr5mfz7g9), he built in pre-web
hypertext navigation (echoing "learn" scripts), a custom search engine, and
open access to \(a\) library catalog search via the then-new Z39.50 search and
retrieval protocol, \(b\) major campus datasets previously available only on
paper (course catalog, schedule of classes, phone directory, job vacancies),
and \(c\) the World Wide Web. Z39.50 interoperation had never been done
previously, requiring heavy investment in several areas. This included
standards development, software development – resulting in release of the first
complete open-source client-server codebase – and the first true
interoperability demonstration, conducted between UC Berkeley, Penn State
University, and the UC Division of Library Automation.

* As Infocal became web-aware, Kunze began to work with identifier standards.
In 1994 he declined principal editorship of the URL specification, and instead
[agreed to write](https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/28.pdf) the functional
requirements in an attempt to unblock the URL standard, which was at an impasse
because the average URL link (web address) was seen to break (stop working)
after about 100 days. His proposed requirents permitted URLs to break and was
published as [RFC1736](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1736), resulting in
immediate approval of the first URL standard as
[RFC1738](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738). As part of a 3-year fellowship
at the US National Library of Medicine (NLM), he analyzed the persistent
identifier landscape and in 2000 defined the framework for the NLM
multi-dimensional [permanence levels](https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2kk13d8kdh).

* To deal with broken URLs at the California Digital Library (CDL), Kunze
created the [ARK \(Archival Resource
Key)](https://n2t.net/ark:/13030/c7n00zt1z) persistent identifier scheme
in 2001. With the goal of addressing broken links flexibly and affordably while
leveraging the NLM permanence levels, he evolved the [ARK
specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-ark/), created the
ARK resolver and registration infrastructure, and registered the first 600 ARK
organizations. In 2018 with help from DuraSpace, he led the creation and growth
of the ARK Alliance ([arks.org](https://arks.org)). By the end of 2025, there
were over 1720 ARK organizations, including 12 national libraries, 215
universities, 254 archives, 144 museums, 124 journals, and 59 scientific
centers. The non-paywalled ARK identifier is vital for open knowledge linking
across world cultural and scientific institutions, especially in the global
South.

* Motivated by the Unix philosophy favoring simple, extensible tools that
combine easily and by a distaste for siloed solutions, Kunze developed
open source tools for ARKs that also work for non-ARK identifiers.
The Name-to-Thing ([N2T.net](https://n2t.net)) resolver supports ARKs as well
as hundreds of
[compact identifier schemes](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.29), the [EZID
identifier service](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ezid-easy/9978331)
supports ARKs and DOIs (URNs, PURLs, and IGSNs were planned), the [Noid (Nice
Opaque Identifier) tool](https://metacpan.org/dist/Noid/view/noid) mints
billions of ARK and Handle identifiers, and
[THUMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-thump/)
specifies inflections for ARKs that work with any URL-based identifiers.
He also co-authored
[RFC1625](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1625) (WAIS) and
[RFC2056](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2056) (Z39.50 URLs).

* A key takeaway from his protocol interoperability work, especially for
[nonbibliographic
applications](https://uh-ir.tdl.org/items/c12d000a-5b3d-4df3-868f-9f64033f0e96),
was the notion of shared attributes such as title, author, and date.
This inspired him to propose the Uniform Resource Citation
([URC](https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s218wxzv0w5)) in 1992 and to join the Dublin
Core initiative in 1995 to focus on a new thing being called metadata.\‡
There he led publication of the world's first metadata standards
([RFC2413](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2413),
[RFC2731](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2731), [ANSI/NISO
Z39.85](https://webstore.ansi.org/preview-pages/NISO/preview_ANSI+NISO+Z39.85-2001.pdf)),
upon which most metadata schemas are based: Schema.org, OAI-PMH, MODS, METS,
EPUB, DataCite, Darwin Core, etc. Considering metadata to be far from finished,
he created the minimalist [Dublin Kernel](https://n2t.net/ark:/13030/c7rr1pm49)
based on his Z39.50 work, the [TEMPER date
format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-temper/), and a vision
\(1996\) of a kind of
["Dublin Mantle"](https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/A_Unified_Element_Vocabulary_for_Metadata/5212459?file=8901253)
that he that he would later implement as the
[YAMZ.net vocabulary builder](https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2zg7dwqz6t).

* In 2003 Kunze wrote the vision for a Library of Congress (LC) grant to
harvest and preserve at-risk websites. Under that grant, he published the
[first draft of the WARC
standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-warc/), now used in all
large-scale web archiving (e.g., Internet Archive). To move files between
archives, he worked with the LC team as principal author of the BagIt standard
([RFC8493](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8493)), which is widely deployed in
libraries and archives (LC, Stanford, Cornell, Dryad, etc). He also created
repository microservice specifications used in HathiTrust
([Pairtree](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-pairtree/)), BagIt
([Oxum](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-oxum/)), and
[OCFL](https://ocfl.io/)
([Namaste](https://ocfl.io/draft/implementation-notes/)).

\† Not everyone knows that a few years before the web appeared, dozens of
custom-built state-of-the-art [networked information
systems](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1402) were emerging at
universities for the purpose of sharing diverse types of information with
students, faculty, staff, and the general public. In this brief era of the
[Campus Wide Information System
(CWIS)](https://search.syr.edu/permalink/01SYU_INST/1gbpq8j/alma9911067813408496),
institutions of higher education effectively piloted the web insofar as they
worked out presentation and maintenance of heterogeneous online data over
network protocols such as FTP, NNTP, Z39.50, and Gopher. From the University of
Minnesota, Gopher was the first CWIS software packaged for easy installation,
and just as thousands of non-campus sites were adopting it, the WWW software's
winning hypertext capability overtook it.

\‡ This usage likely comes from the [1993 IETF URI Working Group
